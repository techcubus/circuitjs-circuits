Expirements porting circuits in to falstad's circuitjs simulator

  * Simulator website:
    https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html

  * Simulator GitHub:
    https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1

These are not error free and expirements in working in the simulator with various existing circuits. I am not an electrical engineer and am trying to learn how these work by recreating them, but I can't really help with them. :( Feel free to contact me about them, however. If you wish to play around with these in the simulator, either download my files from GitHub and open them in the simulator, or just open the text files in the GitHub viewer and paste all the file text in to the "Import From Text..." menu option.
